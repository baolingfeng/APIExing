plot a circle with pyplot
surprisingly I didn't find a straight-forward description on how to draw a circle with matplotlib.pyplot ( please no pylab ) taking as input center ( x , y ) and radius r . I tried some variants of this :
... but still didn't get it working .
I'm sure it's possible to do this , but matplotlib is aimed mainly at plotting ( i.e. here are some data , put them on a graph ) , not drawing , so it might not be entirely straightforward .
Radius of scatterplot points is increasingly used to visualize data . Google charts calls them " bubble plots " . Gapminder.org is a good exmaple . This is plotting , not drawing . I searched the matplotlib github repo for " bubble " and " scatter radius " to no avail , so I don't think this is on the to-do list as far as adding a feature .
plt.scatter() does take a size argument . You can pass lists for the x- and y-coordinates of circles , the circles ' radii , and the circles ' colors . matplotlib.org/1.3.1/api . My error earlier , in thinking that such functionality was not already in matplotlib .
You need to add it to an axes . A ` Circle ` is a subclass of an ` Artist ` , and an ` axes ` has an ` add_artist ` method .
Here's an example of doing this :
This results in the following figure :
The first circle is at the origin , but by default ` clip_on ` is ` True ` , so the circle is clipped when ever it extends beyond the ` axes ` . The third ( green ) circle shows what happens when you don't clip the ` Artist ` . It extends beyond the axes ( but not beyond the figure , ie the figure size is not automatically adjusted to plot all of your artists ) .
The units for x , y and radius correspond to data units by default . In this case , I didn't plot anything on my axes ( ` fig.gca() ` returns the current axes ) , and since the limits have never been set , they defaults to an x and y range from 0 to 1 .
Here's a continuation of the example , showing how units matter :
which results in :
You can see how I set the fill of the 2nd circle to ` False ` , which is useful for encircling key results ( like my yellow data point ) .
I like this answer because you're " drawing " a circle , rather than plotting . Though plotting would have been my first instinct too .
Why do artists like Ellipse not respect pylab.ion() or matplotlib.interactive ( True ) ? E.g. , a call to xlabel() ( after calling ion() or interactive ( True )) updates the figure immediately , but anything involving these Ellipse objects requires an explicit pylab.show() or matplotlib.show() .
FYI : It looks like the Circle class has moved from matplotlib.pyplot to matplotlib.patches since this answer was written .
But but but the circles are oval !
@USER see my other answer : stackoverflow.com/questions/9230389
If you want to plot a set of circles , you might want to see this post or this gist ( a bit newer ) . The post offered a function named ` circles ` .
The function ` circles ` works like ` scatter ` , but the sizes of plotted circles are in data unit .
Here's an example :
What does ` transform= ax.transAxes ` do ?
@USER That's for the circle in right-lower corner , transform the data into axes coordinate , i.e. ( 1 , 1 ) means right-upper corner in axes , ( 1 , 0 ) means right-lower corner , etc .
This should be a part of matplotlib .
A quick condensed version of the accepted answer , that suited my need to quickly plug a circle into an existing plot . Refer to the accepted answer and other answers to understand the details .
By the way :
gcf() means Get Current Figure
gca() means Get Current Axis
Perfect ! just exactly what I needed to see right now.Your ' By the way ' was quite helpful too ! ` dir ( fig )` shows me over 30 ' get ' methods , but ` gca ` has no ` get_current_axis ` alias . These kinds of fyi answers are wonderful .
@USER Nice , quick and easy solution for beginners .
you can actually do ` plt.gca() ` instead of ` plt.gcf() .gca() `
Or , if you prefer , look at the ` path ` s , http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/users/path_tutorial.html
Trignometric equation of a circle and degress 0 tp 360 , which translates to 0 to 6.28319 radians mathopenref.com/coordparamcircle.html
If you aim to have the " circle " maintain a visual aspect ratio of 1 no matter what the data coordinates are , you could use the scatter() method . http://matplotlib.org/1.3.1/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.scatter
Thank you so much . I was having a hard time with the aspects ratios and circles . Scatter worked like a charm .
